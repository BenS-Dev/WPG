                        <p>RRSPs are a vital part of retirement planning. Designed by the federal government as an incentive to save for retirement, RRSPs offer a wide range of investment options and saving opportunities.</p>
                        <p>RRSPs offer tax savings by allowing taxes on funds earned to be deferred until a later date when the funds are withdrawn. Further tax savings may be possible using a Spousal RRSP to split future income between yourself and a lower-income earning spouse.</p>
                        <p>While designed for retirement, the government has also established programs to withdraw RRSPs to achieve other life goals, including education (Life Long Learning Plan) and home ownership (Homebuyerâ€™s Plan).</p>`;

                        <p>Pension funds transferred to a LIRA cannot be cashed out but must be used to purchase a life annuity from an insurance company, transferred to a Life Income Fund (LIF), or to a Locked-In Retirement Income Fund (LRIF), providing a pension income for life.</p>
                        <p>The LIRA owner may purchase a life annuity at any age or transfer their pension funds to a LIF or LRIF at any time prior to the end of the year in which they turn 69 years of age.</p>`;

                        <p>RRIFs have a minimum amount that must be taken out each year as established by the Canada Revenue Agency, but no maximum limit is applied to RRIFs.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that all RRSP funds need to be transferred either to a RRIF or an annuity account by the end of the year in which the plan holder turns 69.</p>`;

                        <p>LRIFs/LIFs provide the holder with an annual retirement income and have both a minimum and a maximum amount that may be withdrawn within a calendar year.</p>
                        <p>Each province has its own pension legislation and regulations regarding transfers into LRIFs and LIFs to protect the funds from being used before retirement.</p>`;
