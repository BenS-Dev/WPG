                            <p>RRSPs are a vital part of retirement planning. Designed by the federal government as an incentive to save for retirement, RRSPs offer a wide range of investment options and saving opportunities.</p>
                            <p>RRSPs offer tax savings by allowing taxes on funds earned to be deferred until a later date when the funds are withdrawn. Further tax savings may be possible using a Spousal RRSP to split future income between yourself and a lower-income earning spouse.</p>
                            <p>While designed for retirement, the government has also established programs to withdraw RRSPs to achieve other life goals, including education (Life Long Learning Plan) and home ownership (Homebuyerâ€™s Plan).</p>`;

                            <p>LIRAs are similar in design and nature to RRSP accounts. The main difference is that LIRAs are designed specifically to hold locked-in pension funds of a former plan member, their spouse, or common-law partner.</p>
                            <p>Pension funds transferred to a LIRA cannot be cashed out but must be used to purchase a life annuity from an insurance company, transferred to a Life Income Fund (LIF), or to a Locked-In Retirement Income Fund (LRIF), providing a pension income for life.</p>
                            <p>The LIRA owner may purchase a life annuity at any age or transfer their pension funds to a LIF or LRIF at any time prior to the end of the year in which they turn 69 years of age.</p>`;

                            <p>RRIFs are used at retirement to move RRSP funds into a stream of retirement income. By transferring money from your RRSP into a RRIF contract, you can begin to receive funds on a monthly or annual basis.</p>
                            <p>RRIFs have a minimum amount that must be taken out each year as established by the Canada Revenue Agency, but no maximum limit is applied to RRIFs.</p>
                            <p>It should be noted that all RRSP funds need to be transferred either to a RRIF or an annuity account by the end of the year in which the plan holder turns 69.</p>`;

                            <p>Similar to RRIFs, LRIFs and LIFs are purchased with \"locked-in\" retirement funds such as another LIF, LIRA, or \"locked-in\" pension fund transfers.</p>
                            <p>LRIFs/LIFs provide the holder with an annual retirement income and have both a minimum and a maximum amount that may be withdrawn within a calendar year.</p>
                            <p>Each province has its own pension legislation and regulations regarding transfers into LRIFs and LIFs to protect the funds from being used before retirement.</p>`;

                                <li><strong>Contributions:</strong> Annual contribution limit is $5,500, which typically increases with inflation in $500 increments, and unused contribution room can be carried forward indefinitely.</li>

                                <li><strong>Withdrawals:</strong> Withdrawals are tax-free, and you can re-contribute withdrawals within a calendar year without affecting your contribution limit.</li>
